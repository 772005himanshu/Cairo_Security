## Renaming Variable in Upgradable Contracts
Differently than solidity, contract storage in Cairo is not organized in slots.
When upgrade contracts using proxies and implementation contracts you can actually reorder storage Variables as you want since no indexing is made behind the scene.

If you are upgrading the contract `Name` of variable should remains same . If name is changed the contract see different area in storage.


## Dangerous low level calls on direct storage Access

When there is need to access the smart contract storage on a low level, things may get tricky.When you want to read/write from/to storage variables in more efficient way than usual by using low level calls such as `storage_read_syscall()` and `storage_write_syscall()`.

#### Using `storage_read_syscall()` low Level
- `storage_read_syscall(address_domain: u32, address: StorageAddress)` system call direct access to any possible key in storage , in contrast `var.read()`
- `StorageAddress` it is the address we want to read the data from the storage


#### Using `storage_write_syscall()` low Level
- `storage_write_syscall(address_domain: u32, address: StorageAddress, value: felt252)` system call direct access to any possible key in storage , in contrast `var.write()`
